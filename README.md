# KSI: Komogorov-Smirnov Importance Statistic

This is the package that we used in [Cornwell et al 2014](10.1111/1365-2745.12208).

The package can be installed using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools), which itself can be installed from CRAN with

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once devtools is installed, run

```
library(devtools)
install_github("traitecoevo/ksi")
```

and the package will be installed.

There is really only one useful function in the package: `ksi`.  See the help page `?ksi` for more information once installed and loaded.
